This repository demonstrates a common Java error: the ConcurrentModificationException.  The `ConcurrentModificationExceptionExample.java` file shows the problematic code, which attempts to remove an element from an ArrayList while iterating through it using a for-each loop. This leads to the exception. The `ConcurrentModificationExceptionSolution.java` provides a corrected version using an Iterator to safely modify the list during iteration.
